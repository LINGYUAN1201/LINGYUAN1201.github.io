This article provides a comprehensive study and predictive modelling of the digital economy sector with China's telecommunications, media and technology (TMT) industry as the subject of this study. Therefore, the share prices of listed companies in the TMT sector are selected in this study to assess their relative values at different stages. An optimised recurrent neural network was also employed to predict future stock price trends. This study not only reveals the direction of business planning for digital transformation, but also finds that the optimised deep learning model has a wide range of applications among business research.
