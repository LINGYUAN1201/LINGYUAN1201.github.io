Under the new pattern of "double cycle", promoting the quality development of railway infrastructure construction has become an important support point for the sound development of the economy and society. However, under the new pattern, there is still no accurate direction on how to build railway infrastructure under the background of double circulation to achieve better two-way development. Therefore, in this study, we collected relevant data on the railway track development status from 2012 to 2020, judged the current railway track industry development status through the compertz curve model, and established an index system to comprehensively evaluate the coupling degree of the railway track industry demand market, So as to get practical conclusions and provide directions for the development of the railway track industry.
