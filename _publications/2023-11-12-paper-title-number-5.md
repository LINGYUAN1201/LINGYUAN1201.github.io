Based on carbon emission market conditions with environmental and energy factors, this paper constructs a stochastic complex network game model. The model innovatively considers the impact of spillover effects on the strategic choices of each player and can be generalized to other scenarios.

By the way, based on this research, I am designing a function gen_dynamic that allows for the simulation of a wide range of complex network games, which you can find in Open Access.
