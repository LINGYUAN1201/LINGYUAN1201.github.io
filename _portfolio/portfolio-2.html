In this study, various machine learning algorithms were chosen to downscale high-dimensional economic data. Among them, principal component analysis has the best effect on the dimensionality reduction of high-dimensional data. But at the same time, the kernel function based on SVM is also very effective in dimensionality reduction processing, and has a strong economic interpretation.
