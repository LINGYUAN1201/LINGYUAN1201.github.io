## Project Overview

This research addresses key operational challenges in the car-sharing industry by developing a forecasting framework for **booking duration** and **vehicle utilization** at the city level.  

Leveraging real-world operational data from Co-Wheels, we implemented **time series forecasting models**â€”including **Auto/Manual ETS**, **SARIMA**, and **Linear Regression**â€”to generate 30-day forward predictions. These models were evaluated based on their accuracy and robustness under different demand scenarios.

## Research Objectives

- **Predict booking durations** across cities to support dynamic fleet allocation.
- **Estimate vehicle utilization** using booking logs and real usage data.
- Improve forecasting performance through **automated model selection**, **data decomposition**, and **seasonality analysis**.

## Methodology Highlights

- **Data Processing**: Outlier detection using Z-score; imputation via seasonal patterns; structural breakpoint identification.
- **Modeling**: Comparison between automatic and manual ETS/SARIMA; linear regression for interpretable trend analysis.
- **Evaluation**: Forecast accuracy assessed using MAE, MSE, and RMSE metrics across total and day-of-week slices.
