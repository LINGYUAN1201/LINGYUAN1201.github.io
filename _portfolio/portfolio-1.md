In this study, the traditional recurrent neural network model was optimised to a certain extent, and the loss functions of the RNN, GRU and LSTM algorithms were stabilised after a certain amount of time iterations. The prediction is carried out based on industry-specific data, and the final prediction accuracy is higher than that of traditional time series prediction models.
