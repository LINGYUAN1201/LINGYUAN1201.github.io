My current research focuses on optimization strategies for dynamic pricing in electric vehicle (EV) energy services, with a specific emphasis on charging and battery swapping systems.  Addressing the challenges posed by uncertainty demand, the project combines stochastic modeling to predict demand variations and reinforcement learning to develop adaptive, real-time pricing strategies.
