**Purpose** - This study aims to explore the impact of generative artificial intelligence (GAI) technology applications on enterprise operations management from the perspective of the supply chain.

**Design/Methodology/Approach** - This research adopts an event study methodology, analyzing the changes in enterprise value of U.S. publicly traded companies based on news announcements related to the application of generative artificial intelligence technology. The event study employs the market model, the market-adjusted model, and the Carhart four-factor model to estimate abnormal returns in the stock market. Additionally, cross-sectional regression models are used to examine the effect of generative artificial intelligence announcements on corporate stock market value.

**Practical Implications** - This study quantitatively assesses how news announcements regarding the application of generative artificial intelligence technology influence the stock market value of publicly traded companies and provides recommendations for corporate managers on the adoption of emerging technologies.

**Originality/Value** - By utilizing secondary data, this study fills a research gap on the impact of widespread generative artificial intelligence technology application news announcements on corporate stock market value, exploring this relationship from a supply chain perspective for the first time. Furthermore, this research provides empirical evidence for studies on U.S. publicly traded companies.
