In this study, system dynamics simulation is introduced into business studies. A mathematical model is constructed based on the elements of benefits, costs, losses and penalties of each subject, and the influence of each element on the subject's decision-making is analysed by solving the dynamic differential equations. And use Python, MATLAB and Netlogo to simulate the dynamic game behaviour among multiple subjects.
