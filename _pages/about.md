Hello, I'm Ling Yuan. This is my personal homepage.

During my undergraduate years, I studied economics and statistics, and focused on statistical modelling, econometrics and time series analysis. Currently, I have mastered some econometric models, machine learning algorithms. My research interests are sustainable development, game theory, econometrics and financial machine learning

My main research work is based on r-language and I have learnt software like MATLAB, Python, Eviews. Therefore I am committed to open access and I will share my code and research on Github and my personal homepage.

Here is my CV[CV](https://maifile.cn/est/d2486964977037/pdf).
