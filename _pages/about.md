Hi, I'm Ling Yuan. This is my personal homepage.

Currently, my academic research primarily focuses on the fields of Operational Research and operations management. I am deeply engaged in a range of research activities, some of which are detailed under the ["Working Projects"](https://lingyuan1201.github.io/working-projects/) section. Additionally, tools developed from these projects can be found under the ["Open Access"](https://lingyuan1201.github.io/open-access/) section.

Due to my current technical capabilities, the tools I have developed at this stage still have certain limitations (such as the requirement for high-performance CPUs and GPUs, high-speed internet, and substantial bandwidth).  Nevertheless, I am dedicated to optimizing these tools to make them more adaptable to a broader range of application environments.
