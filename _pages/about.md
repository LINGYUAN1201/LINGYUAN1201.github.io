Hi, I'm Ling Yuan. This is my personal homepage.

During my undergraduate studies, I studied economics and statistics, and focused on statistical modelling, econometrics and time series analysis.

Currently, my main research interests are sustainable development, game theory, econometrics and risk prediction. I am conducting some research, which you can find under " Working Projects ". I have also published some research articles, which you can find under "Publications".

I am an invited reviewer for some well-known academic journals, such as *International Review of Financial Analysis(ABS-3)*, *Finance Research Letters(ABS-2)*, *Energy Strategy Reviews(JCR-Q1)*, and so on.

My main research work is based on R. I have also learnt MATLAB, Python, Eviews and other software. I am committed to open access and I will share my code and research on Github and my personal homepage.

Here is my [CV](../assets/Ling_CV__1.pdf).
