Hi, I'm Ling Yuan. This is my personal homepage.

During my undergraduate studies, I studied economics and statistics, and focused on statistical modelling, econometrics and time series analysis.

Currently, I studied some econometric models, machine learning algorithms. My main research interests are sustainable development, game theory, econometrics, and risk prediction. I have published some articles, you can find them in "Publications".

I am also an invited reviewer for some well-known academic journals, such as International Review of Financial Analysis, Finance Research Letters, Energy Strategy Reviews, and so on.

My main research work is based on R. I have also learnt MATLAB, Python, Eviews and other software. Therefore, I am committed to open access and I will share my code and research on Github and my personal homepage.

Here is my [CV](../assets/Ling_CV__1_.pdf).
