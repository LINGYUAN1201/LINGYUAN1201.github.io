Hi, I'm Ling Yuan. This is my personal homepage.

Throughout my undergraduate tenure, I pursued an academic trajectory focused on Economics and Statistics, where I delved extensively into the realms of statistical modeling, econometrics, and time series analysis.

At present, my scholarly pursuits pivot around the spheres of sustainable development, game theory, econometrics, and risk forecasting. I am actively immersed in a spectrum of research endeavors, meticulously detailed within the "Work Projects" section. Moreover, you will find an anthology of my scholarly contributions under the "Publications" tab.

I am privileged to hold the esteemed role of a peer reviewer for distinguished academic journals, such as *International Review of Financial Analysis(ABS-3)*, *Finance Research Letters(ABS-2)*, *Energy Strategy Reviews(JCR-Q1)*, and so on.

My proficiency predominantly centers on leveraging the R language for research, complemented by adeptness in MATLAB, Python, and Eviews. Committed to the ethos of open access, I fervently advocate for the dissemination of knowledge and actively share my methodologies, algorithms, and research findings through platforms such as GitHub and my personal homepage.

I eagerly anticipate the opportunity to share deeper insights into my scholarly endeavors and collaborative possibilities with you.

Here is my [CV](../assets/Ling_CV__1.pdf).
