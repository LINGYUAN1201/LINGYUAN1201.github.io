Hi, I'm Ling Yuan. This is my personal homepage.

Currently, my academic research primarily focuses on the fields of operations research and operations management.   I am deeply engaged in a range of research activities, some of which are detailed under the "Working Projects" section.   Additionally, tools developed from these projects can be found under the "Open Access" section.

Here is my [CV](../assets/Ling_CV__1.pdf).
