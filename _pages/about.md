Hi, I'm **Ling Yuan**. 

I will begin my **PhD in Management** at *Cardiff University* in **September 2025**, funded by the ESRC Doctoral Training Partnership. The research will focus on improving circular economic operations by characterizing, forecasting, and managing reverse logistics flows, in collaboration with industrial partners such as **Brother Industries UK Ltd** and **The Royal Mint**.

Previously, I completed an **MRes in Management Science** at *Lancaster University*, where I worked on revenue management and pricing optimization for car rental systems. My undergraduate degree was in **Statistics** from *Suzhou University*, where I graduated top of my cohort.

## üõ†Ô∏è Tools & Open Access

I actively develop open-access analytical tools as part of my research:

- **[Event Study Tool](https://github.com/LINGYUAN1201/event_study)** ‚Äì Python package for financial event analysis  
- **[Event Analysis (R)](https://github.com/LINGYUAN1201/EventAnalysis)** ‚Äì R-based tool for market event impact assessment  
- **[Sentiment Analysis Tool](https://github.com/LINGYUAN1201/Sentiment_Analysis)** ‚Äì Transformer-based sentiment pipeline

These tools are designed for advanced use cases and may require high-performance environments (e.g., strong CPUs/GPUs and sufficient bandwidth). I am continuously working on improving their performance and portability.

More tools can be found under the [**Open Access**](https://lingyuan1201.github.io/open-access/) section.
