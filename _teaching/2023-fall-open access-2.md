This MATLAB code generates and analyzes a growing network graph. The main functionalities include:

1. *Network Growth* :It starts with an initial set of nodes (m0) and progressively adds new nodes (up to N) along with edges. The edges are added based on specified conditions, such as isolated nodes, a complete graph, or random connections.

2. *Visualization* :The code generates coordinates for nodes and plots the evolving network graph. Initial nodes are marked in red, and edges are drawn with green lines.

3. *Degree Calculation* :It calculates the degree of each node in the network, representing the number of edges connected to each node.

4. *Degree Distribution* :It analyzes and plots the distribution of node degrees in the network.

5. *Pajek Data Generation* :It includes a call to a function (assuming `Matlab_to_Pajek`) to generate Pajek data from the generated network. Pajek is a software tool used for the analysis and visualization of large networks.

Please note that the specific details of network growth and visualization depend on user input (initial conditions and parameters) and the random generation of nodes and edges. The code is designed to provide insights into the evolving network structure and its properties.
