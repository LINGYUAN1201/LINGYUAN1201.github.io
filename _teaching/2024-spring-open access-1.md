`DynamicNetSim` is an R package designed for simulating dynamic networks and game-theoretic interactions. This package provides a set of tools that facilitate the creation, manipulation, and visualization of dynamic networks, as well as the simulation of game-theoretic scenarios within these networks.

## Dependencies

DynamicNetSim imports the following R packages:
- igraph
- stats

Make sure these packages are installed and up to date.

## Functions
DynamicNetSim includes the following main functions:

- `gen_dynamic(N, L, aver_k, net_type, game_type, visualize)`: Generates a dynamic network and simulates game-theoretic interactions.
