This tool is designed to solve the problem of sentiment classification and prediction using advanced transformer-based models. 

## Introduction
`Sentiment_Analysis` is a Python-based package designed for sentiment classification and prediction. It leverages pre-trained transformer models (e.g., DistilBERT) to analyze text and categorize it into predefined sentiment classes such as "Positive," "Neutral," and "Negative." This package is highly customizable and supports fine-tuning for domain-specific datasets.

You can use this tool to:
- Train sentiment analysis models on your own dataset.
- Predict the sentiment of text data in real-time or batch mode.
- Visualize training metrics such as loss curves and confusion matrices.
- To install the package and run sentiment analysis, you can clone the repository and install the dependencies:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/LINGYUAN1201/Sentiment_Analysis.git
cd Sentiment_Analysis
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
For training a new model, run:
```bash
python train_and_test.py
```
To use the trained model for prediction:
```bash
python predict_sentiment.py
```
